**Contributing to Matrix**

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Matrix and its packages, which are hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request. Commits which do not comply with the coding standards will be ignored (use gofmt!).
